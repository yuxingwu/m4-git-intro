# Exercise-1

The purpose of this exercise is to practice the steps you'll need to use in future exercises. We'll begin by configuring your GitHub account for your machine (which you'll only need to do once), and then move through the steps of working with Git and GitHub (which will soon become second nature).

1. If you haven't already, configure your name and email address for your GitHub account using the terminal.
2. Fork this repository (`info-201/m4-git-intro`) to your own GitHub account by clicking the `fork` button on the GitHub interface.
3. Using your terminal, clone **your forked repository** to your machine (make sure you're in the desired directory on your terminal)
4. On your machine, open up this file (`exercise-1/README.md`) in a text editor of your choice
5. In the `README.md` file, make an ordered list of what you ate for breakfast today
6. Using your terminal, add and commit the changes you've made to your repository
7. Push changes up to GitHub
